PSEP (position-specific evolutionary preservation) measures the length of time (in millions of years) a position in current protein has been preserved by tracing back to its reconstructed direct ancestors. The longer a position has been preserved, the more likely that it will have a deleterious effect. We convert this to a probability of deleterious effect (Pdel) from results on theÂ HumVar benchmark. We convert this Pdel to a qualitative prediction as follows: "probably damaging" (time > 450my, corresponding to a false positive rate of ~0.2 as tested on HumVar), "possibly damaging" (450my > time > 200my, corresponding to a false positive rate of ~0.4) and "probably benign" (time < 200my).
