## Uncovering Genetic Variations in the CAPN10 Gene: A Comprehensive SNP Analysis

### Introduction:
The Calpain 10 (CAPN10) gene has emerged as a key candidate in the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Understanding the role of genetic variations within CAPN10 is crucial for elucidating its contribution to T2DM susceptibility. This project aims to conduct a comprehensive SNP analysis of the CAPN10 gene to identify potential functional variants associated with T2DM.

### Objectives:

Retrieve SNP data: Collect high-quality SNP data within the CAPN10 gene region from public genomic databases such as dbSNP and 1000 Genomes Project.

Functional annotation: Predict the functional significance of identified SNPs using bioinformatics tools such as SIFT and PolyPhen-2 to assess their potential impact on protein structure and function.

Linkage disequilibrium analysis: Investigate the patterns of linkage disequilibrium and identify haplotype blocks within the CAPN10 gene region to understand the genetic architecture.

Association analysis: Assess the association of identified SNPs with T2DM susceptibility using available genetic datasets and perform statistical analyses to determine their significance.

Functional validation: Validate the functional relevance of prioritized SNPs using in vitro assays or functional genomics approaches to elucidate their role in T2DM pathogenesis.
